Network / blockhash sanity check.

The Surfpool localnet implementation embeds a recognizable prefix into
every blockhash it returns. We use this to catch the common footgun where
a client signs a transaction against a Surfpool RPC and submits it to a
server configured for a real cluster (mainnet/devnet).

The check is asymmetric:

  - If the blockhash starts with the Surfpool prefix, the transaction
    was DEFINITELY signed against a Surfpool localnet. The only network
    slug for which that's valid is `localnet` — any other slug must
    reject the credential up-front.

  - If the blockhash does NOT start with the Surfpool prefix, we can't
    tell what cluster it came from (real localnet doesn't add a prefix
    either), so we accept it.

The Lua server delegates transaction decoding to user-provided
`verify_payment` callbacks (since Lua has no built-in Solana SDK), so this
module exposes a pure check that callback authors must invoke once they
have the blockhash in hand.
