"""Network / blockhash sanity check.

The Surfpool localnet implementation embeds a recognizable prefix into
every blockhash it returns. We use this to catch the common footgun where
a client signs a transaction against a Surfpool RPC and submits it to a
server configured for a real cluster (mainnet/devnet).

The check is asymmetric:

* If the blockhash starts with the Surfpool prefix, the transaction was
  DEFINITELY signed against a Surfpool localnet. The only network slug
  for which that's valid is ``localnet`` — any other slug must reject the
  credential up-front.

* If the blockhash does NOT start with the Surfpool prefix, we can't
  tell what cluster it came from (real localnet doesn't add a prefix
  either), so we accept it.
